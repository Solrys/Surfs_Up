# Surfs_Up
Creating data for a potential Surf and Ice cream shop in Hawaii 

### For this project I will be implementing the following tools such as 
* SQLite
* SQLAlchemy
* Flask 

These tools will allow me to utilize SQL database structures and querying methods. I will also be writing and executing Python code in a Jupyter notebook and create graphs using Python.

### Objectives
* Explain the structures, interactions, and types of data of a provided dataset.
* Differentiate between SQLite and PostgreSQL databases.
* Use SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database.
* Use statistics like minimum, maximum, and average to analyze data.
* Design a Flask application using data.

In order to make the best choices for planning my surf shop in Hawaii as well as possibly gain the support and interest from potential investors it was imperative that my planning would be informed by data to minimize financial risk. A potential investor may be concerned about the amount of precipitation on Oahu. There needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much that I lose out on that ideal surfing and ice cream weather.

I will be analyzing precipitation levels to make sure that Oahu as the perfect place to surf. At first I will be analyzing a full year of data to take look at the overall climate picture. Then in order to reinforce my thesis I will zoom out to the last 10 years and compare December and January temperatures.  

I wanted to understand trends in the data. I created a plot of precipitation scores in chronological order to show how much it rained and if it was raining on the previous or subsequent days as well. I addition to plotting my results I want to include a statistical analysisâ€”such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. 

In my analysis I looked for the most active station. This active station will provide the most data and help determine the best location for the surf shop. With the possibility of knowing more data doesn't necessarily equate to more accurate results, analyzing the most active station may provide information on the best weather for surfing and eating ice cream. Temperature is another important aspect of this data. I have therefor looked into the average temp as well as highs and lows. 


### Results

Based on the climate Oahu seems like the ideal place for a surf and ice cream shop.
